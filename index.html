		Jenkins Testing Website
		</h1>
		<p>
		This is a jenkins CI/CD built website
		</p>
		<p>
		I automatically fetches, build and deploys when repository is pushed to.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now 'production' will automaticlaly be deployed when staging run succeeds
		Ideally staging would have tests set up to run, to verify everything works.
